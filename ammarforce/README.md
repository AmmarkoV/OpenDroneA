![AmmarForce](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmmarkoV/OpenDroneA/master/ammarforce/ammarforce.jpg)

The AmmarForce quadcopter is a medium sized drone geared towards flying time and carrying capacity.
It weights 1.6kg with maximum load 2.5kg more. It is equipped with GPS and in the future is also going to have an onboard computer for computer vision use.
For now with the GoPro mounted on it ( which is of negligible weight ) it can fly for around half an hour before the lipo cells fall bellow the 3.2V limit.

In this repository there are the blueprints for the body , along with the configuration of the librepilot CC3D revo controller in order to 3d print it and produce a working copy.
